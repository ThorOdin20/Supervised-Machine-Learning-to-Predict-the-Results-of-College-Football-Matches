# Supervised-Machine-Learning-to-Predict-the-Results-of-College-Football-Matches
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the outcomes of college football games using two classification methods: Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project aims to answer the question of whether one can accurately anticipate the results of a football game by examining historical game data, team statistics, time of the day, and other relevant features.
